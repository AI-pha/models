# Contributing to inrc_ecosystem

Everyone is welcome to contribute. Patches may be submitted using GitHub pull
requests (PRs). All commits must be signed off by the developer (--signoff)
which indicates that you agree to the Developer Certificate of Origin.  Patch
discussion will happen directly on the GitHub PR. Design pre-work and general
discussion occurs on the [mailing list]. Anyone can provide feedback in either
location and all discussion is welcome. Decisions on whether to merge patches
will be handled by the maintainer.

## Process

1. Submit Github pull request (PR) for any new feature or bug fix
2. Explain any architectural changes or network topology with diagrams for reviewers
3. Run pylint scan on the codebase after making changes
4. Ensure you have a README if you are adding a new tutorial/model/module
5. If you have dependency on another module, use git submodule to create a link
6. Mention the version of nxsdk you used to verify on the README
7. (Preferred) Add unit tests

As soon as you create a PR, we will acknowledge the commit in __2 days__.

Reviewers should get back to you within __10 days__ with either a go-ahead or might
request more information or need more time to review the change. We expect reviews 
to finish within __4 weeks__.

Once the PR is ready to be merged, one of the reviewers will merge your changes.
